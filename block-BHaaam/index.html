                    <p>The Acra (also spelled Akra, from Ancient Greek: Ἄκρα, Hebrew: חקרא ,חקרה‎ Ḥaqra(h)) is both the name of a fortified structure and also one of three residential areas in Jerusalem during the late Second Temple period from which it takes its name. This area, also known as the "Lower City",[1][2][3][4][5] corresponds today with Silwan and the City of David, along with its sister part of "The Upper Market" (Hebrew: שוק העליון‎), also known as the "Upper City",[1][6][7] and the newer suburb known as Bezetha ("New City").[8] Acra is the shortened-form of the Greek loanword akrópoli, adopted in Aramaic usage and having the connotation of "citadel" or "stronghold",[9] a place thought to have once had a fortified compound built by Antiochus Epiphanes, ruler of the Seleucid Empire, following his sack of the city in 168 BCE. The capture of the Lower City (Acra) played a significant role in the formation of the Hasmonean Kingdom, and in the Maccabean Revolt when the city was captured by Judas Maccabeus[10][11] and the fortress destroyed by Simon Thassi.[12] In the center of this part of the city lay the Pool of Siloam.The exact location of the original fortress Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had long been a matter of lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography, and previously discovered artifacts. Yoram Tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform as a clue to the Acra's possible position. During Benjamin Mazar's 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount, features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge cistern. In 2015, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the City of David.The exact location of the original fortress Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had long been a matter of lengthy discussions.

                        According to Josephus, the area known as Acra (Ancient Greek: Ἄκρα) was built on a hill and spread out in the "shape of a dome".[13] The "Valley of the Cheesemakers" (the Tyropoeon) separated its hill from the adjacent area known as the Upper City, or what David called the "Citadel" (Ancient Greek: φρούριον)(Hebrew: מצודת ציון‎).[1] </p>
                        <p>The Ancient Greek term acra / akropolis was used to describe other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period. The Acra is often called the Seleucid Acra to distinguish it from references to the Ptolemaic Baris as an acra and from the later quarter in Jerusalem which inherited the name Acra.
